ðŸŒ™ lunarr     ][     goguardian suppressor




*    You successfully loaded the [ðŸŒ™ lunarr] suppressor!

*    Make sure not to close the DraftLunarr page (Draftback tab) or the Blank page (Untitled tab) as that will stop updating the extension configuration.

*    Also I would recommend opening the tab every now and then or just keeping the tab open at all times to prevent chrome-tab sleep (tab sleep pauses JavaScript execution to reduce cpu usage)

*    If this isn't working or it just stops working just go back to the Blank page
